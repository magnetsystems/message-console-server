                <p>The traditional one-size-fits-all model no longer applies. Every mobile app uniquely integrates with its own set of web services and data sources and presents them through an engaging and relevant user experience. Developers should focus on designing the user interface and experience of mobile apps, and not worry about the back-end server infrastructure.</p>

                <p>We take care of the hard part of building the cloud-based Mobile App Server and the matching Mobile App SDK so you can focus on building great mobile apps.</p>

                <p>Just specify requirements for your mobile app and, within a few minutes, youâ€™re ready to use the Mobile App SDK in your favorite language to begin building your mobile app within your favorite IDE.</p>

                <p>When you are ready, test your mobile app by instantly deploying the Mobile App Server Runtime locally or in the cloud. Why wait days or weeks for your IT to setup a simple server instance? You can do it yourself.</p>
