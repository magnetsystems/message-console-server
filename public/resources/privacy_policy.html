            <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>

            <p>Last Updated: August 13, 2013</p>

            <p>Magnet Systems, Inc. ("Magnet," "we," "our" or "us") is committed to respecting the privacy and security of your personal information. The following U.S. online privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") describes the information we collect and how we use it. By using this website ("Site") or the service offered through our Site (the "Developer Factory"), you consent to our Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>We may periodically update this Privacy Policy to reflect material changes in how we collect, use, share or store your personal information.  We encourage you to refer to this Privacy Policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current Privacy Policy.  You consent to any changes we make to this Privacy Policy if you continue to use the Magnet service after receiving a notice of the change or upon our posting of the new Privacy Policy on this Site.</p>

            <strong>COLLECTING INFORMATION</strong>

            <p>Like many websites, we gather information about how visitors use our Site. In general, you can visit many of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We may track your visit for trends and statistics, but you will remain anonymous unless you tell us who you are. Once you choose to give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us.</p>
            <p>The following are the types of information we collect:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Information you give us: We receive and securely store the information you provide to us when you register for, or otherwise use, the Site such as your name, email address, phone number, address, credit card information and any feedback, questions, or recommendations you provide.  The Developer Factory allows you to submit questions and comments in public areas of the Site, and such information may read, collected, and used by us and other users of the Site.  If you provide information directly to us in other ways, such as by sending us an email, we may retain that information and add it with the other information we have collected from you.</li>
                <li>Information from third parties: We may receive information about you from other sources, such from friends who refer you to us, or otherwise.  We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you.</li>
                <li>Automatically collected information: To make our Site and Developer Factory more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) may collect information from you, including browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date and time stamp for your visit.  We also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and which you viewed.  Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this information and store it in log files each time you visit our Site or access your account on our network.  "Cookies" are small pieces of information that a Site sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a web site.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.  Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.  If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of our Site or portions of the Developer Factory may not work properly.</li>
            </ul>
          
            <strong>USING INFORMATION</strong>

            <p>We use and disclose your personal information only as described in this Policy or as otherwise disclosed to you on our Sites. For example, we may use or disclose your personal information:</p>

                <li>To operate and improve our Sites;</li>
                <li>To fulfill your requests for certain products or services;</li>
                <li>To better understand your needs and provide you with more customized service.</li>
                <li>To communicate with you about the Sites or our products and services</li>
                <li>To respond to any questions or concerns that you may have;</li>
                <li>For market research, project planning, troubleshooting problems, detecting and protecting against errors, fraud, or other criminal activity;</li>
                <li>To third-party contractors that provide services to us and are contractually bound to safeguard your personal information (i.e. credit card processers);</li>
                <li>To third parties in connection with any merger, acquisition, reorganization, change in capital structure or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Magnet;</li>
                <li>To third parties service providers designated by you with your express consent;</li>
                <li>When we have a good faith believe that disclosure is necessary to comply with law, protect or defend our rights or the rights of other users of our Sites or products or services, or act in an emergency to protect someone’s safety; or</li>
                <li>Otherwise with your express consent.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We may create non-personally identifying anonymous or aggregate data from the information we collect. We may use that anonymous or aggregate data for our own purposes or disclose it to third parties in our own discretion.</p>
